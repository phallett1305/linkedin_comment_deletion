# Delete Linkedin Comments (Others to follow).

## linkedin_comment_deletion
A script to walk through and delete all of your comments

### What
Script for automated deletion of Linkedin Comments, in case you've been a little too left wing, or a little too rude.  Both unacceptable in todays LinkedIn it would appear.

Disclaimer: these scripts will ruthlessly delete ALL your Linkedin Comments. It was made for that. Use at your own risk.

### Why
As of now, Linkedin doesn't offer a bulk-delete option for personal activity. There's also no API available for that. 

### How
Use the scripts provided here to delete comments.  I will add newer versions of the other elements (Post and likes) at a later date.

#### Open your web browser;
1. Go to the correct Linkedin page (see below);
2. Open the browser's JavaScript console;
3. Paste the corresponding script in the JavaScript console;
4. Execute it!
5. After a while, no more comments.

It will show the delete dialogue box, so just leave the page open and make a cup of team

**Note: it may be necessary to refresh the page and restart the script from time to time.**

#### Comments
Use delete-comments.js to delete all comments authored by you. Open your browser and go to Me >> Posts & Activities (or https://www.linkedin.com/in/{username}/detail/recent-activity) and execute the script from the JavaScript console.

### FAQ

#### How do I use the JavaScript console on my favorite browser?
Firefox: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Tools/Browser_Console

Chrome: https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools/console

Safari: https://developer.apple.com/safari/tools

#### Why do they throw so many errors?
I updated https://github.com/onceiwasadev script (as I couldn't participate in his project) as they didn't work, and have handled as many errors as I can, but it was, like his, a personal bit of work, so caveat emptor and all that.
